  "description": "World Driven - Democratic Pull Request Management Through Contribution-Based Voting.\n\nWorld Driven transforms how open source projects handle pull requests by implementing a fair, transparent, and automated merge system based on contributor participation.\n\nHow It Works:\n- Pull requests are automatically merged after a configurable time period (default: 10 days)\n- Contributors can vote on PRs through GitHub's native review system\n- Approve a review to speed up the merge\n- Request Changes to slow it down or block the merge\n- Vote weight is proportional to contributions to the project\n\nPerfect for open source projects with distributed maintainership, teams wanting democratic code review processes, and communities prioritizing contributor empowerment.",
